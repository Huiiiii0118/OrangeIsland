// Watches the shell for the attention signal of WeChat, QQ and the mailbox. None of them reliably posts a notice this app can
// read — WeChat's own popup window, the system's toast store and the window's accessibility tree have all proven empty on a
// current build — but each flashes its taskbar button when a message waits, and a dock (Winstep Nexus, RocketDock and the rest)
// shows the same flash on its own icon.
//
// The flash is not a state any interface exposes — the accessibility trees carry no "flashing" flag, and the taskbar's own
// elements do not reach a client through UI Automation. What the system does announce is the flash itself: a window that
// registers with RegisterShellHookWindow receives a SHELLHOOK message with the code HSHELL_REDRAW and the flashing window's
// handle each time a top-level window is flashed. That is exactly the message the docks live on — which is why their icons
// flash in step with the taskbar — so one hook covers the taskbar and every dock at once, with no sampling and no searching.
//
// A flash that stops is the message having been read: the program is in front of the user, which the foreground hook announces
// at once, or it stopped flashing on its own, which a few quiet seconds announce.
